That‚Äôs an awesome project idea, especially for someone at your level‚Äîpractical, scalable,
and aligned with real-world fintech systems. Here's how you can plan it out so it looks impressive 
on GitHub, LinkedIn, and your resume:

---

### üîß Tech Stack (Leverage Your Current Skills)
- **Backend:** Java 17+, Spring Boot
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (for relational parts), Cassandra (for scalable product/transaction history)
- **Cache:** Redis (for session, credit checks, product lookups)
- **Queue:** Kafka (for asynchronous processing like BNPL verification, repayment reminder)
- **Infra:** Docker, K8s, AWS (ECS or EKS, RDS, S3, CloudWatch)
- **Security:** Spring Security (JWT + Role-based auth)

---

### üèóÔ∏è Core Modules
#### 1. **User Service**
- Register/login with credit limit (default ‚Çπ10,000)
- Fetch available credit
- View past orders/repayment history

#### 2. **Merchant Service**
- Register merchant
- Add/update/delete products
- Define discount rules

#### 3. **Product Service**
- Search products by merchant/category
- Show real-time pricing (with or without discount)

#### 4. **Order Service**
- Create cart ‚Üí Add/remove products
- Choose payment type: Pay Now / BNPL
- Generate invoice

#### 5. **BNPL Service**
- Credit eligibility check
- Credit deduction and due generation
- Repayment API (full/partial)
- Auto repayment scheduler (cron + Kafka)

#### 6. **Admin Service (Optional)**
- View system analytics (total BNPLs, repayments, defaults)
- Adjust user credit limits manually

### üåê API Examples
```http
POST /users/signup
POST /merchants/{id}/products
POST /orders
POST /orders/{id}/pay (PayNow or BNPL)
POST /repayments/{orderId}
```

---

### üì¶ Extra Touches for Impact
- **Audit Logs**: Store all payment/credit updates with timestamps.
- **Rate Limiting**: Apply to APIs to prevent abuse.
- **Unit & Integration Tests**: Use JUnit + Mockito + Testcontainers
- **Monitoring**: Integrate Prometheus + Grafana dashboards
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or GitLab pipeline with Docker builds and K8s deployments

---

### üß† Smart Extensions (For AI/ML Edge)
- **Credit Scoring Engine**: Use dummy ML logic for advanced BNPL eligibility
- **Discount Recommendation**: Suggest merchants/products based on past orders

Would you like me to generate the complete backend blueprint for this 
(service structure, package structure, DB schema, etc.) next?
