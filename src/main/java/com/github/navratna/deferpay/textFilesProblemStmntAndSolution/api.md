Absolutely! Below is a clean and RESTful **API design** for your BNPL system covering **Users,
Merchants, Products, Orders, BNPL, and Repayments**.

I'll break them down by **entity/module** so you can easily implement them in Spring Boot:

---

## 🔐 **Auth APIs (JWT-based)**
```
POST   /api/auth/signup         → Register (User or Merchant based on role)
POST   /api/auth/login          → Login and get JWT token
```

---

## 👤 **User APIs**
```
GET    /api/users/me                    → Get my profile
GET    /api/users/me/credit             → View current credit and available balance
GET    /api/users/me/orders             → List all orders (BNPL & regular)
GET    /api/users/me/repayments         → View repayment history
POST   /api/users/me/repayments/{id}    → Repay for a BNPL order
```

---

## 🏪 **Merchant APIs**
```
POST   /api/merchants                   → Register a new merchant (optional if signup handles this)
GET    /api/merchants                   → Get list of merchants
GET    /api/merchants/{id}             → Get merchant details
```

---

## 📦 **Product APIs**
```
POST   /api/merchants/{id}/products     → Add a product under a merchant
PUT    /api/products/{productId}        → Update product
DELETE /api/products/{productId}        → Delete product
GET    /api/products                    → Search products (by name/category/merchant)
GET    /api/products/{productId}        → View single product detail
```

---

## 🛒 **Order & Cart APIs**
```
POST   /api/cart/add                    → Add item to user cart
POST   /api/cart/remove                 → Remove item from cart
GET    /api/cart                        → View current cart

POST   /api/orders                      → Place order from cart
GET    /api/orders/{id}                 → Get order detail
```

---

## 💳 **Payment / BNPL APIs**
```
POST   /api/payments/paynow            → Make instant full payment
POST   /api/payments/bnpl              → Use BNPL (deduct from credit, create due)
GET    /api/bnpl/dues                  → View pending dues (user-specific)
GET    /api/bnpl/dues/{id}             → View specific BNPL detail
POST   /api/bnpl/dues/{id}/repay       → Repay a specific due
```

---

## 📊 **Admin APIs (Optional)**
```
GET    /api/admin/users                → View all users
PATCH  /api/admin/users/{id}/credit    → Update user credit limit
GET    /api/admin/analytics            → View system-level metrics
```

Would you like me to generate:
- OpenAPI (Swagger) spec?
- Spring Controller interfaces for all these?
- A DB schema to match these APIs?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed.
